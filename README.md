# tagbar-man

To be used with the **vim** editor and [tagbar](https://github.com/majutsushi/tagbar).

Generate ctags for **man pages**.

This allows showing a table of contents in tagbar.

Works only on Linux.

(Note: I push this to github for archival reasons, but reading the issues at tagbar's repo I think there is now another, probably better way available).
